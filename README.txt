/* BUILD THE PROJECT */
/* =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= */

Before you can actually compile and run this project, you 
first have to install the required dependencies using the
following commands:

$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install make pkg-config libsdl2-dev

After this is done, you're now able to change into the
project directory and run the "make" command to compile
the full project. The output-file is called "game" and
to start the game itself, just execute the binary.
